# Removing Git History

To completely remove all Git history and start fresh with your current codebase, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Create New Repository (Recommended)

This method creates a completely fresh repository with no connection to the old history:

```bash
# 1. Backup your current code (just in case)
cp -r identiverse-2025-ics identiverse-2025-ics-backup

# 2. Remove the .git directory
cd identiverse-2025-ics
rm -rf .git

# 3. Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# 4. Add all files
git add .

# 5. Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - clean repository"

# 6. If you need to push to the same remote (optional)
# First, add the remote
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>

# 7. Force push to overwrite the remote repository
git push -f origin main  # or 'master' depending on your branch name
```

## Option 2: Using Git Commands (Alternative)

If you prefer to maintain the same repository but remove history:

```bash
# 1. Create an orphan branch (has no parents)
git checkout --orphan temp_branch

# 2. Add all files to the new branch
git add .

# 3. Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit - clean repository"

# 4. Delete the main branch
git branch -D main  # or 'master' depending on your branch name

# 5. Rename the current branch to main
git branch -m main

# 6. Force push to the remote repository
git push -f origin main
```

## Notes

- This process is **irreversible** - all history will be permanently removed
- All collaborators will need to clone the repository fresh after this change
- Any open pull requests will be lost
- Consider using option 1 if you also want to clean up any potentially large files in Git history
